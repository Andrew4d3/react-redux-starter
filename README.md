# React-Redux Starter
### by Andrew4d3
This is a boilerplate designed to kickstart frontend projects using react and redux. It's built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so you'll be able to use any tool/library included there and other libraries and utilities I included like:
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheet proccessor
- Pre-commit hook linter ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/))
- UI unit-tests using [Enzyme](https://eslint.org/)

## Requirements
- Node.js 6.11.4 or higher

## Setting up
1. Clone the repo: `$git clone https://github.com/Andrew4d3/react-redux-starter.git`
2. Install dependecies using: `$npm install` or if you prefer use yarn: `$yarn install`
3. Run the project with `$npm start`

## Project Structure
The project main files are located at the `/src` folder which is pretty much the frontend root. So you'll be working majorly there.
```
/src (root)
  /assets (to locate images and other static files)
  /common (to locate common functions or modules used across the app)
  /main (app's entry point)
  /modules (to locate the multiple components used by your app)
```
The project structure you will find on this boilerplate just follows my personal preference. You are free to organize your project on the way you find more convenient to do it.
